# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise fund her play "Fever". Louise would like to see how well kickstarters work and would like us to narrow it down so she is not looking at all kickstarters, only the ones that relate to her. We are looking at kickstarters dated from 2009 to 2017 to help Louise figure out when and how to fund her play. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To start the analysis all kickstartes were filtered by Theater into a pivot table. The data was then filtered by outcomes: successful, failed, or canceled. The graph below was created using those filters and shows how the kickstarters do based on the month of the year. ![Outcomes based on launch date](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94948877/147180767-51e8cfaf-825f-4156-909d-d3d30aa5b6f6.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This data set was created based on the goals that were set by the kickstarters. This was filtered down by Theater along with the subcatgegory "plays" to get a more accurate data set for Louise since she is specifically funding a play. This is also looking at only outcomes that were successful, failed, or canceled because we do not want to see the live kickstarters. The following graph was created using this data set. ![Outcomes based on Goal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94948877/147277744-c4a0eac0-6463-4b1a-9af1-7528cfeea610.png)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountere
This data set did have dates for when they were launched but they were in Unix Timestamp which was not readable. This required me to create another column with the converted time to be able to sort the data by the date they were launched. Using excel functions I was able to do this fairly easily. This was needed so we could see when the best time of the year would be to launch a kickstarter. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
